# 🎟️ Decentralized Event Ticketing

**Decentralized Event Ticketing** is an open innovation project that reimagines how event tickets are created, distributed, and verified — built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP).

---

## 💡 Why This Project?

Traditional ticketing is often expensive, centralized, and vulnerable to fraud and scalping. This project replaces traditional middlemen with **smart contracts** that issue **tokenized tickets** directly on the blockchain — guaranteeing **authenticity**, **traceability**, and **transparency**.

---

## 🔑 Key Benefits

- 🎫 **Tokenized Tickets** — every ticket is unique, verifiable, and impossible to forge.
- 🔒 **Fraud Prevention** — tickets cannot be double-sold or counterfeited.
- 💰 **No Scalping** — secondary sales can be controlled by smart contract logic.
- 🔗 **Trustless Transfers** — users can buy or sell tickets peer-to-peer without intermediaries.
- 🌐 **Open Access** — anyone can verify ticket ownership on-chain.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Rust smart contracts (canisters) on ICP
- **Frontend:** React & TypeScript for modern, responsive interfaces
- **Blockchain:** Internet Computer Protocol for decentralized hosting and execution
